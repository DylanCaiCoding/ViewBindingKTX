[ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) reduces exceptions caused by id or type errors, which are recommended by both Google officials and Jake Wharton, but it can be a bit cumbersome to use, so this library can **help you use ViewBinding with as little code as possible in any usage scenario**.
